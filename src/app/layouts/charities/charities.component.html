    <p class="card-text">One way Sheetz Employees stay involved with our communities is through our corporate charities, Sheetz For the Kidz™ and Special Olympics. These are programs we support on a large scale, company wide. The Sheetz For the Kidz program is extremely special to us because it was created by our own employees.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Sheetz for the Kidz</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Sheetz For the Kidz™ was created by two Sheetz district managers looking for a new way to uphold the Sheetz tradition of giving back to their communities. They wanted to give underprivileged children the kind of holiday so many other kids enjoy. That first year, 1992, employees raised $12,000 and took 126 children shopping for toys, clothes and other basic necessities.</p>
    <p class="card-text">Annually, the charity partners with The Salvation Army® who selects families within each store's community to participate in the program. Each store supports 16 children in their community. We receive wish lists for each child from The Salvation Army and our employees shop, and host drive-through gift distributions in each of our operating areas. Employees present the parents/guardians with the gifts that were purchased specifically for their children and gift wrapping supplies to wrap the presents and have them ready for the holidays! In 2022, we supported 11,000 kids across our six-state operating area.</p>
    <p class="card-text">Sheetz For the Kidz™ developed a partnership with Make-A-Wish® in 2005. Through a donation of $150,000 that year, the charity sponsored 30 families of seriously ill children for an all-expenses-paid, dream vacation to Orlando, Florida, fulfilling their "wish." Sheetz For the Kidz™ continues to work with the good people of this organization to grant wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions. The charity sponsors one child per Sheetz operating district each year, totally 61 wishes in 2022.</p>
    <p class="card-text">In an effort to broaden our connection in the communities we serve, Sheetz For the Kidz™ began a partnership with Feeding America® in 2019 to provide food to kids in need. Feeding America works with a network of 27 local food banks and agency partners, including food pantries, soup kitchens, and meal programs to allocate these funds based on Sheetz store locations. In 2022, the charity made a $685,000 contribution that supported over 1.5 million meals through child-hunger programs.</p>
    <p class="card-text">Since 1992, Sheetz For the Kidz™ has impacted more than 160,000 children living in the communities that Sheetz serves.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Special Olympics</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Sheetz is a proud supporter of Special Olympics. Our partnership began in 1991 in Pennsylvania and we've expanded our involvement to include Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia.</p>
    <p class="card-text">For the Special Olympics of Pennsylvania Summer Games, Sheetz employees volunteer their time to escort athletes onto the field as part of the parade of athletes during the opening ceremonies. Sheetz volunteers prepare hundreds of delicious lunches that are handed out to athletes along with water, ice and snacks. We also operate a prize wheel in Olympic Village that is a favorite amongst athletes.</p>
    <p class="card-text">At the closing ceremonies each year, one athlete is presented with the Sheetz Family Award of Excellence. Winners are chosen based on their exceptional sportsmanship, courage, dedication and positive attitude.</p>
    <p class="card-text">At new store openings, we donate money to benefit both the state and local chapters of Special Olympics as part of our grand opening ceremonies. We also collect money for Special Olympics year-round in donation cans on the counters in our stores.</p>
    <p class="card-text">We are proud to have received one of our highest honors, being inducted into the Special Olympics Pennsylvania Hall of Fame, in March 2000.</p>
    <p class="card-text">Through donation cans and our own contributions, we have raised more than $2.5 million dollars for Special Olympics since 1991.</p>
