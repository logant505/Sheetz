      <h5 class="card-title">Committed to an Inclusive and Equitable Culture</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Sheetz has promised to create a more inclusive and equitable culture that benefits our stores, employees, and our communities. We know that honoring and recognizing our employees’ and customers’ diverse experiences, individual identities and unique perspectives makes us a stronger organization and partner in every community we serve.

    </p>
    <p class="card-text">The Sheetz family, our executives and leadership across the organization are working to identify actions that will lead to real progress. To that point, Sheetz has formally incorporated Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility (IDEA) into our corporate strategy. This work includes tactical focus on resourcing, planning and education. Over the past year, we have made substantial progress toward educating our organization’s leadership teams and making them aware of topics associated with IDEA. We are also working with independent experts, discovering how we can translate this work to our employees, customers, and suppliers – and to create real change across the company. Part of that change is supporting organizations making a difference in our communities. Most recently, Sheetz pledged $100,000 in support of Embrace Race, an organization providing educational resources to parents in order to talk to their kids about race. You can read more about our major partners in this effort, here.</p>
    <p class="card-text">We know that this is just a start. That’s why we are committed to an ongoing assessment of our culture and values to ensure that all employees and customers feel a sense of belonging at Sheetz. We are also pledging to increase diverse representation across our organization, through talent development, talent acquisition and promotions, making sure that all employees have the chance to thrive. We are stronger together when everyone feels seen and included.</p>
    <p class="card-text">To maintain our accountability and to keep our communities updated on our progress we will continue to post here. We know that this work will only serve to strengthen our community connections and make Sheetz a better place for everyone.</p>
